# Medicare Provider Fraud Detection

Project Objectives 🏹
❄ Provider Fraud is one of the biggest problems facing Medicare. According to 
  the government, the total Medicare spending increased exponentially due to
  medicare frauds.

❄ Rigorous analysis of medicare data has yielded many physicians who indulge in
  fraud. 

❄ They adopt ways in which an ambiguous diagnosis code is used to adopt costliest
  procedures and drugs. 

❄ The goal of this project is to "predict the potentially fraudulent providers" 
  based on the claims filed by them.
